<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Resources is a collective term for the projects, folders, and files 
 that exist in the Eclipse PDT. The navigation views provide a 
 hierarchical view of resources and allows you to open them for editing. 
 Other tools may display and handle these resources differently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three basic types of resources that exist in the Eclipse PHP 
 PDT:</p>

<h3>Files</h3>

<p>Comparable to files as you see them in the file system.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Folders</h3>

<p>Folders are similar to directories on a file system.&nbsp; In the 
Eclipse PDT, folders are contained in projects or other folders. Folders 
 can contain files and other folders.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>Contain folders and files. Projects are used for builds, version management, 
 sharing, and resource organization. Like folders, projects map to directories 
 in the file system. (When you create a project, you specify a location 
 for it in the file system.)</p>

<p>A project is either open or closed. When a project is closed, it cannot 
 be changed in the Eclipse PDT.&nbsp; The resources of a closed 
 project will not appear in the Eclipse PDT, but the resources 
 still reside on the local file system.&nbsp; Closed projects require less 
 memory.&nbsp; Since they are not examined during builds, closing a project 
 can improve build time.</p>

<p>When a project is open, the structure of the project can be changed 
 and you will see the contents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Folders and files directly below projects can be linked to locations 
 in the file system outside of the project's location. These special folders 
 and files are called linked resources. </p>

<p>Different tools that plug into the Eclipse PDT use their own 
 specialized types of projects, folders, and files.</p>
