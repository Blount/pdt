<h1>PHP Views</h1>

<p>Views support editors and provide alternative presentations as well 
 as ways to navigate the information in the PDT.&nbsp;The Navigator and 
 PHP Explorer views display projects and other resources that you are working 
 with.</p>

<p>Each View has its own menus. To open the menu for a view, click the 
 icon at the left end of the view's title bar (). Some views also have 
 their own toolbars. The actions represented by buttons on view toolbars 
 only affect the items within that view.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a tabbed 
 notebook.&nbsp;You can change the layout of a perspective by opening and 
 closing views and by docking them in different positions in the Workbench 
 window</p>

<p>PHP Views (e.g., PHP Project Outline, PHP Explorer, PHP Functions, Working 
 Sets) display specifically related to PHP projects (e.g., PHP classes, 
 functions, variables, constants, etc.).</p>
