<h1>Perspectives and Views</h1>

<h2>Perspectives</h2>

<p>A perspective is a specific group of<span style="font-style: italic;"> 
 <I></I></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><I><B>views and 
 editor</B></I></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>s</B></span> in the IDE window. 
 One or more perspectives can be accessed from a given window. </p>

<p>Each perspective contains one or more views and editors, each of which 
 provides a different outlook. However, all perspectives share the same 
 set of editors.</p>

<p>The title bar of the Zend Eclipse IDE pane shows which perspective is 
 active.</p>

<h2 class="whs2">Views</h2>

<p>Views are comprised of editors, alternative presentations and &nbsp;navigation 
 tools for manipulating the information in PHP IDE. &nbsp;For 
 example, the Navigator and the PHP Explorer views display the projects 
 and resources that you are working with.</p>

<p>In addition, each View contains the various menus available to it. To 
 open the menu for a view, click the icon at the left end of the view's 
 title bar. </p>

<p>A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a tabbed 
 notebook. You can change the layout of a perspective by opening and closing 
 views and by docking them in different positions in the Workbench window.</p>

<h2>Toolbars</h2>

<p>Views containing several tools generally place them into a toolbar. 
 These tools affect only those items contained within that view.</p>

<p>Views can be active or inactive, but only one can be active at any one 
 time. &nbsp;The 
 active view is the one whose title bar is highlighted and is the target 
 for common operations such as cut, copy and paste. The active view also 
 determines the contents of the status line. If an editor tab is not highlighted 
 it indicates the editor is not active, however views may show information 
 based on the last active editor. </p>
