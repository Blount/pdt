<h2>Editor Preferences</h2>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Editor</span> window is the main 
 area for writing and editing code. More than one Editor window can be 
 open at the same time. The Eclipse PHP Editor enables you to work 
 in both PHP and HTML simultaneously. </p>

<p>The Editor preference types are:</p>

<h3>Preference</h3>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<h3>Code Assist</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Code Assist</span> offers a wide selection 
 of code assistance features including code completion, PHP, HTML, classes, 
 member variables, variables, keyword, and object code completion listings. 
 Lists are comprised from declarations as well as most of the standard 
 PHP and HTML.**</p>

<h3>Folding</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Code folding</span> enables you to 
 “collapse” sections of a source code file while working in other parts 
 of it. This enables you to manage larger amounts of code within one window, 
 without getting lost in a morass of complexity. A folding point is typically 
 a method or a function but can also be an entire class or something as 
 small as an if-then-else block or comment section. </p>

<h3>Hovers**</h3>

<p>The Eclipse PDT supports combined hover, variables value, PHPDoc 
 and source. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Diff</span> feature 
 provides a color-coded change indication while you are typing. When the 
 mouse cursor is placed over a change in the vertical ruler, the hover 
 displays the original content, which can be restored using the ruler's 
 context menu.</p>

<h3>Syntax coloring</h3>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Syntax highlighting</span> feature 
 enables you to display text in different colors and fonts according to 
 the specific syntax (category of term).</p>

<p>The Eclipse PDT Editor can color several languages at the same time 
 and is user configurable in the Preferences window.</p>

<h3>Task tags</h3>

<p>Strings indicating tasks in PHP comments. The entry marked as default 
 will be used in the code templates.</p>

<h3>Typing</h3>

<p>Automatically closes the selected options..</p>
