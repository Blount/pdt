<h2>Navigate Menu</h2>

<p>This menu allows you to locate and navigate through resources and other 
 artifacts displayed in the Workbench.</p>

<h3>Go Into</h3>

<p>This command refocuses the active view so that the current selection 
 is at the root. This allows web browser style navigation within hierarchies 
 of artifacts. </p>

<h3>Go To</h3>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Back</span>:&nbsp; 
 displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately prior to the current 
 display.&nbsp; For example, if you Go Into a resource, then the Back command 
 in the resulting display returns the view to the same hierarchy from which 
 you activated the Go Into command.&nbsp; This command is similar to the 
 Back button in an HTML browser. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forward</span>:&nbsp; 
 displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately after the current 
 display.&nbsp; For example, if you've just selected the Back command, 
 then selecting the Forward command in the resulting display returns the 
 view to the same hierarchy from which you activated the Back command.&nbsp; 
 This command is similar to the Forward button in an HTML browser. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Up one level</span>:&nbsp; 
 displays the hierarchy of the parent of the current highest-level resource. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resource</span>: 
 allows you to navigate quickly to a resource. For more information see 
 the links to related tasks below. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Open PHP Element</h3>

<p>This command displays a dialog that lets you select PHP elements in 
 the workspace and open them in the editor. </p>

<h3>Open Resource</h3>

<p>This command displays a dialog that lets you select general resources 
 in the workspace and open them in the editor.</p>

<h3>Show In</h3>

<p>This sub-menu is used to find and select the currently selected resource 
 in another view. If an editor is active, these commands are used to select 
 the resource currently being edited in another view.</p>

<h3>Next</h3>

<p>This command navigates to the next item in a list or table in the active 
 view. For example, when the search results view is active, this navigates 
 to the next search result.</p>

<h3>Previous</h3>

<p>This command navigates to the previous item in a list or table in the 
 active view. For example, when the search results view is active, this 
 navigates to the previous search result.</p>

<h3>Last Edit Position</h3>

<p>This command allows you to jump the last edit position.</p>

<h3>Go to Line</h3>

<p>This command allows you to jump to a specific line in the active editor.</p>

<h3>Back</h3>

<p>This command navigates to the previous resource that was viewed in an 
 editor. Analogous to the Back button on web browsers.</p>

<h3>Forward</h3>

<p>This command navigates to undo the effect of the previous <span style="font-weight: bold;">Back</span> 
 command. It is analogous to the Forward button on web browsers</p>
