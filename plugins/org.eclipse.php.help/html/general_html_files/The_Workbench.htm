<h1>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE/Workbench)</h1>

<p>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) refers to the desktop development 
 environment. This environment provides a number of tools that are designed 
 to work together in a seamless fashion. These include creation, management, 
 and workspace navigation resources.</p>

<p>Each IDE window contains one or more perspectives. &nbsp;These 
 contain specific, user-definable views, editors and tools for managing 
 and working with certain menus and toolbars. &nbsp;Multiple 
 windows can exist on the desktop at any given time.</p>
