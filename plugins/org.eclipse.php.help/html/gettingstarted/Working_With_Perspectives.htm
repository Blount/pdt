<h1>Working with Perspectives</h1>

<p>A perspective is a group of views and editors which are contained in 
 different panes within the PDT window. They define the initial set and 
 layout of views and the set of functionality available for accomplishing 
 a specific type of task or working with specific types of resources in 
 the Eclipse PDT window.</p>

<p>Each perspective contains one or more views and editors. These are the 
 visible action sets available for use.</p>

<p>Within a window, each perspective may have a different set of views 
 but all perspectives share the same set of editors. Multiple perspectives 
 can be accessed from a single window. </p>

<p>In general, each perspective contains several panes that operate simultaneously 
 in order to provide you with tools and information required to develop 
 your applications efficiently.</p>

<p>The title bar of the Eclipse PDT pane shows which perspective is 
 active. In example here, the PHP perspective is in use.</p>

<ol start="3" type="1" class="whs2">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Click the select perspective icon ( ) at the top 
 right of the window. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Other</B></span> 
 from the drop down list. The Select Perspective dialog will open. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Select <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>PHP</B></span> 
 and click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>OK</B></span>. The PHP perspective 
 will become active. All PHP functionality is now available.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Views can be active or inactive, but only one can be active at any one 
 time. &nbsp;The 
 active view is the one whose title bar is highlighted and is the target 
 for common operations such as cut, copy and paste. The active view also 
 determines the contents of the status line. If an editor tab is not highlighted 
 it indicates the editor is not active, however views may show information 
 based on the last active editor. </p>
