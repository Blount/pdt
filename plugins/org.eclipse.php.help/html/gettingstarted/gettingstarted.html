<h1>Opening the IDE </h1>

<p>When the PHP Eclipse IDE is first launched you will see a dialog 
 that allows you to select where the workspace should be located. This 
 is the directory where your work will be stored. </p>

<ol >
	
	<li ><p>Click <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>OK</B></span> 
 to accept the default location (check the checkbox to prevent this question 
 from being asked again).</p></li>
	
	<li ><p>After the workspace location is chosen, Eclipse 
 opens to the Welcome screen. Click the arrow at the top right to enter 
 the IDE. <span style="margin-left: 0px;">The Eclipse IDE will open.</span></p></li>
</ol>

<p >This will be your work environment. It contains 
 several panes, each of which can contain one or more <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>perspectives</B></span>. 
 These are specific views, each of which contains a defined functionality, 
 e.g., editors, navigators (the PHP Explorer and the Navigator), filters, 
 etc. </p>

<h2><span style="margin-left: 0px;">Perspectives</span></h2>

<p>In general, each perspective contains several panes that operate simultaneously 
 in order to provide you with tools and information required to develop 
 your applications efficiently.</p>
