<h1>PHPdoc Blocks</h1>



<b>PHPdoc blocks</b> are descriptive comments added to application code. 
They are located where a element is first defined and are used to describe it.
<p>The Blocks consist of a short description, a long description 
and phpDoc tags. phpDoc blocks also serve as the input for phpDocumentor and/or the PDT's structured descriptions that are shown attached to Code Assist.


<p class=Note><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If you wish to add a comment to the code but do not want the comment to be visible in the API documentation use standard comments /*.
