<h1>Working Sets</h1>

<p>A Working Set is defined as a set of resources (projects, folders and 
 files) that are joined together. They are used to group elements for display 
 in views or for operations on the set.</p>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If a 
 working set is selected in the Package Explorer or Navigator, only the 
 resources, children of resources, and parents of resources contained in 
 the working set are shown. The Problems View, Tasks View and Bookmarks 
 View can use working sets in their filters. When searching, a working 
 set can be used to restrict the set of elements that are searched. </p>

<p>By default, the Window Working Set is used by default and is unfiltered. 
 </p>

<p>You can place resources of any type into any Working Set regardless of their 
 type (Java, PHP, etc…). A Working Set from within a PHP resource creates 
 a PHP Working Set. </p>

<p>The name of the working set should be unique </p>


<p>While developing PHP applications in the PHP perspective, the Project 
 Explorer view is your main view of your PHP projects and resources.</p>

<p>The Project Explorer view provides an integrated view of all project 
 resources, including PHP resources, Java™ artifacts, resources, Web services, 
 databases, and dynamic Web project artifacts.</p>

<p class=Note><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Newly  created resources are not automatically included in the active working 
 set. They are implicitly included in a working set if they are children 
 of an existing working set element. If you want to include other resources 
 after you have created them you have to explicitly add them to the working 
 set.</p>
