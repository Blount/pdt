<h1>Views</h1>

<p>Views are comprised of editors, alternative presentations and &nbsp;navigation 
 tools for manipulating the information in PDT. &nbsp;For 
 example, the Navigator and the PHP Explorer views display the projects 
 and resources that you are working with.</p>

<p>In addition, each View contains the various menus available to it. To 
 open the menu for a view, click the icon at the left end of the view's 
 title bar. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a tabbed 
 notebook. You can change the layout of a perspective by opening and closing 
 views and by docking them in different positions in the Workbench window.</p>

<h2>Toolbars</h2>

<p>Views containing several tools generally place them into a toolbar. 
 These tools affect only those items contained within that view. </p>
