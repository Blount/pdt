<h1>Perspectives</h1>

<p>Each Zend Eclipse IDE window contains one or more <span style="font-weight: bold;">Perspectives</span>. 
 A perspective defines the <span style="font-style: italic;">set of views 
 and their layout</span>, in the IDE window. </p>

<p>Within a window, each perspective shares the same set of editors. </p>

<p>Each perspective provides a set of functionality for accomplishing a 
 specific type of task or that enables working with specific types of resources.&nbsp;For 
 example, the PHP perspective combines views that you would commonly use 
 while editing PHP source files, while the Debug perspective contains the 
 views that you would use while debugging PHP programs. </p>

<p>Perspectives define the types of information that appears in some of 
 the menus and toolbars. They define visible action sets, which you can 
 change to customize a perspective. You can save a perspective that you 
 build in this manner, making your own custom perspective that you can 
 open again later.</p>

<p>You can open perspectives in the same window or 
 in a new window.</p>
